1. Innovations in React and Flux
===================

* Unique qualities React has to offer:
  - JSX - writing markup (HTML) in JavaScript.
  - Virtual DOM - minimizes expensive updates to the DOM. React => Virtual DOM => DOM.
                When UI changes, React compares the old state with the new state in memory and ten updates the DOM in the least expensive way.
  - Isomorphic Rendering - allows to render the React components on both Client and Server. 
  - Unidirectional Flows (Flux) - data flows are handled in a single direction using the centralized dispatcher.

* React and Flux deliberately ignore some commonly held best practices:
  - HTML should be a projection of app state, not a source of truth, i.e. data shouldn't be stored in DOM.
  - JavaScript and HTML belong in the same file (JSX).
  - Unidirectional flow. No two-way binding.
  - Inline styles can be good.
